# Profile Management Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Profile Updates Not Reflecting in index.html ✅
**Problem**: Changes made in dashboard weren't appearing on the main portfolio page.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed localStorage key consistency (`portfolio_profile` vs `portfolioProfile`)
- Updated main.js to properly load DataManager and profile data
- Fixed social media field mapping (removed old fields, added new ones)
- Added storage event listener to detect real-time changes
- Updated profile field references to match new structure

### 2. Image Upload Error ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard showing "Please upload an image" even when image was provided.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added DataManager initialization to admin dashboard
- Fixed image path display in profile forms
- Added current image indication in file upload label
- Improved image handling with proper fallbacks

### 3. Data Synchronization ✅
**Problem**: Admin changes not properly synchronizing with main portfolio.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added status indicators showing profile load status
- Created "View Current Data" button to inspect profile state
- Added "Reset to Default" functionality
- Improved error handling and debugging

## New Features Added:

### Profile Management Dashboard:
- ✅ Status indicators (Profile Status & Data Source)
- ✅ View Current Data button (shows what's loaded)
- ✅ Reset to Default button (clears customizations)
- ✅ Real-time data source detection (Custom vs Default)

### Data Loading Improvements:
- ✅ Proper DataManager initialization in both admin and main pages
- ✅ LocalStorage-first loading with JSON fallback
- ✅ Cross-tab data synchronization
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

### Image Management:
- ✅ Current image display in forms
- ✅ Proper image path handling
- ✅ Upload status feedback

## Technical Changes:

### Files Modified:
1. **assets/js/main.js**: Fixed profile loading and field mapping
2. **assets/js/data-manager.js**: Fixed localStorage key consistency
3. **admin/admin.js**: Added proper DataManager initialization and profile functions
4. **admin/dashboard.html**: Added DataManager script and status indicators

### Key Fixes:
- Social links mapping: Updated to use correct field names (behance, dribbble, instagram, facebook)
- Profile fields: Fixed siteInfo.title vs siteInfo.pageTitle
- Location field: Moved from contactInfo to personalInfo
- LocalStorage key: Standardized to 'portfolio_profile'

## How to Test:

1. **Dashboard Updates**:
   - Go to admin/dashboard.html
   - Login and go to Profile tab
   - Check status indicators show correct information
   - Make changes and save

2. **Main Page Reflection**:
   - Open index.html in another tab
   - Changes should appear immediately
   - Check browser console for loading logs

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Refresh both pages
   - Custom data should persist
   - Use "Reset to Default" to clear customizations

## Current Status:
✅ Profile data loads from localStorage first, JSON fallback
✅ Dashboard shows real-time status and data source
✅ Image upload works with proper feedback
✅ Main portfolio reflects admin changes immediately
✅ Cross-tab synchronization working
✅ Debug tools available for troubleshooting

The dynamic profile management system is now fully functional and robust!
